# Custom Command Buttons

Add custom buttons to the Visual Studio Code status bar to execute terminal
commands with a single click.

## Description

The **Custom Command Buttons** extension allows you to enhance your productivity
by adding custom buttons to the VS Code status bar. Each button can be
configured to run a specific terminal command, making it easier to execute
frequently used commands without leaving the editor.

## Features

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Easily add, edit, or remove buttons using a graphical
  interface.
- **Customizable Buttons**: Configure button text, tooltip, color, alignment,
  priority, and terminal name.
- **Execute Terminal Commands**: Run any terminal command directly from the
  status bar.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Changes to buttons are applied immediately without
  restarting VS Code.

## Usage

### Adding Custom Buttons

1. **Open the Command Palette**

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).

2. **Run the "Manage Custom Buttons" Command**

   - Type `Manage Custom Buttons` and select it from the list.

3. **Use the GUI to Add Buttons**

   - Click on **Add Button** to create a new custom button.
   - **Fill in the Required Fields:**
     - **Text**: The label displayed on the button (e.g., `Build Project`).
     - **Command**: The terminal command to execute when the button is clicked
       (e.g., `npm run build`).
   - **Optional Fields:**
     - **Tooltip**: A brief description shown when hovering over the button.
     - **Color**: Choose a color for the button text using the color picker.
     - **Alignment**: Position the button on the `left` or `right` side of the
       status bar.
     - **Priority**: A number determining the order of buttons; higher numbers
       are placed more prominently.
     - **Terminal Name**: Specify a name for the terminal that runs the command.

4. **Save Changes**

   - Click on **Save Changes** to apply the updates.
   - The new buttons will appear on the status bar immediately.

### Using the Buttons

- Click on any custom button in the status bar to execute its associated
  terminal command.
- The command will run in a new terminal within VS Code.

### Editing or Deleting Buttons

1. **Open the "Manage Custom Buttons" GUI**

   - Use the Command Palette to run `Manage Custom Buttons`.

2. **Modify Existing Buttons**

   - Update the fields for any button as needed.
   - Click **Save Changes** to apply updates.

3. **Delete Buttons**

   - Click on the **Delete** button next to a custom button to remove it.
   - Save changes to update the status bar.

## Troubleshooting

### Buttons Not Appearing

- Ensure that both the **Text** and **Command** fields are filled out for each
  button.
- Click **Save Changes** after adding or editing buttons.
- Reload VS Code if the buttons do not appear after saving.

### Commands Not Executing
